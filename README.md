# Market Segmentation Using Clustering(Objective)

This project applies unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering) to perform customer segmentation. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior to help businesses better target marketing strategies.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualizations  
- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler  
- Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters  
- K-Means Clustering Algorithm  
- Cluster Visualization

## Extended Work: Supervised Learning Integration
- Converted clustering results into labels to simulate a real-world supervised classification problem.  
- Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the customer features and the assigned cluster labels.  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification report.  
- Demonstrated how clustering can help in building downstream supervised models for prediction tasks.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome
- Successfully segmented customer data into distinct clusters using unsupervised learning.  
- Visualized cluster groupings to derive business insights.  
- Built a decision tree classifier to predict customer segments using clustering-based labels.
